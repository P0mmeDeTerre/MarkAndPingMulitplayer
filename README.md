and search for `MarkTeam`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d44b3b9-bd4d-4944-93a7-fc4fcf30c9f6)

A member must be in only one team.

### Add Team
To add a team in your `MarkTeamComponent` you can use the `Add Team` node from the component

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845a7638-2b95-4a1c-a103-a7e1437ff24e)

* `Name` : Team name
* `Color` : Color of the ping/mark
* `Icons` : Icons for members
* `Ping Lifetime` : Lifetime of a ping

Icons is an array of textures. This is used when a player from this team pings something. Each player on a team can have their own icon to help differentiate them from one another. This is optional, but you need to provide an array to this function. If no icons are set or not enough icons are provided for the members who need them (e.g., if you set 2 icons but have 3 players on the team), the third player will use the default icon set in `PingComponet`.

### Remove Team
Remove a team from `Mark Team Component`

* `Team Name` : Team name

### Add Member
To add a member to a specific team you can use the `Add Member` node

* `Team Name` : Team name
* `Member` : Player Controller reference from the event `OnPostLogin`

You are not required to use the pin from the `OnPostLogin` event, but you must provide a reference to the `PlayerController` of the member.
